# Demo Usage

Currently the demo supports visualization for:

- Image Folder: A set of frames that were decoded from a given video.
- Video: I only tested `.mp4`, but other video format should be OK.

## Inference on a image folder

The command line should be like this:

```shell
    python demo/demo.py ${METHOD} ${CONFIG_FILE} ${CHECKPOINT_FILE} [--visualize-path ${IMAGE-FOLDER}] [--suffix ${IMAGE_SUFFIX}][--output-folder ${FOLDER}] [--output-video]
```

Example:

```shell
    python demo/demo.py base configs/vid_R_101_C4_1x.yaml R_101.pth --suffix ".JPEG"\
        --visualize-path datasets/ILSVRC2015/Data/VID/val/ILSVRC2015_val_00003001 \
        --output-folder visualization [--output-video]
```

This will generate visualization result using single frame baseline with ResNet-101 backbone. And the results, images
with generated bboxes, are saved in folder `visualization`.

Please note that:

1. If your want to use other methods like MEGA, FGFA, please change METHOD `base` to `mega` or `fgfa`. Currently all
   methods support visualization, see [`demo.py`](demo.py) for more information about using other methods.
2. Don't forget to modify CONFIG_FILE and CHECKPOINT_FILE accordingly!
3. Add `--output-video` to generate video instead of set of images, the video is encoded at `25` fps by default.
4. If you want to visualize your own image folder, please make sure that the name of your images is like `XXXXXX.jpg`
   . `XXXXXX` is the frame number of current frame, e.g., `000000` is the first frame. `.jpg` could be replaced by other
   common image suffix like `.png`, which could be specified by `--suffix.`

## Inference on a video

The command line should be like this:

```shell
    python demo/demo.py ${METHOD} ${CONFIG_FILE} ${CHECKPOINT_FILE} --video [--visualize-path ${VIDEO-NAME}] [--output-folder ${FOLDER}] [--output-video]
```

Example:

```shell
    python demo/demo.py base configs/vid_R_101_C4_1x.yaml R_101.pth --video \
        --visualize-path datasets/ILSVRC2015/Data/VID/snippets/val/ILSVRC2015_val_00003001.mp4 \
        --output-folder visualization [--output-video]
```

This will generate visualization result using single frame baseline with ResNet-101 backbone. And the results, images
with generated bboxes, are saved in folder `visualization`.
